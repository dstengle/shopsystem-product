# Glossary

## How the list combines

The defined-term list is this glossary combined with every schema element
name. Per the `use-defined-terms` principle, a writer choosing between
terms uses one of these when one fits.

## Terms

- **artifact type** — a named, schema-defined document type (e.g.
  `decision-brief`); the term the schema registry uses. Not "kind".
- **data type** — a named, schema-defined structure that is not a
  human-readable document (e.g. `review`); passed between process steps.
- **simple type** — a JSON Schema primitive (`string`, `integer`,
  `boolean`, `array`, `object`), usable inline without registration.
- **typedef** — the single source a type is generated from; templates and
  schema fragments are its renderings (owned by shopsystem-knowledge).
- **schema** — the machine-checkable shape of a type: fields, types,
  enums, required sections.
- **process definition** — the source of truth for a process: header
  (purpose, outcomes, roles), data section, steps section.
- **step** — one unit of a process: an agent step (carries a prompt) or a
  runtime step (carries `set`, `run`, or `branches`; no prose).
- **rendering** — a generated output of a definition (a skill, a
  diagram, a template); never edited by hand, never the source of truth.
- **guiding statement** — an optional header element of a process
  definition that directs judgment across the whole process; compiled
  into every rendering.
- **fitness set** — judged (never executed) Given/When/Then scenarios
  scoring an artifact type's quality.
- **guideline** — prose quality rules for an artifact type, each with a
  test, a criterion, and a yes/no decision.
- **role** — a named seat with a capability contract and
  accountabilities; sequencing lives in process definitions, not roles.
- **principle** — a standing rule about how we work: name, statement,
  rationale, implications (see the principles document's opening
  definition).
- **seed layer** — the hand-ratified definitions the regress terminates
  at: the principle set plus one typedef per definition document type.
- **owner** — the seat that ratifies changes to a definition; named in
  every definition's frontmatter.
